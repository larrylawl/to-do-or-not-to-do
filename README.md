# TO DO LIST
Hi! I'm Larry Law (A0189883A). <br>
I've built a <b>dynamic</b>, <b>mobile friendly</b> To Do List with <b>CRUD operations</b> and <b>tagging system</b>. <br>
Other features include: Checkboxes, Quick Edit, Quick Submit, Delete all
completed, and a Charmander <br>
My choice of tools are `Rails, HTML+CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap`. <br> <br>

You can find the final product <a href= "https://young-reef-14225.herokuapp.com/">here </a> and my final report <a href = "./CVWO Final Submission">there</a>.<br>

Enjoy!
